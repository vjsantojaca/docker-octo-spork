# Docker Compose files üõ≥Ô∏è

This repository contains a Docker Compose file for setting up some utils.

## Getting Started
Compose simplifies the control of your entire application stack, making it easy to manage services, networks, and volumes in a single, comprehensible YAML configuration file. Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration file.

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

brew install docker
```

sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/latest/download/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
docker compose version
```
- Colima
```bash
brew install colima
```
